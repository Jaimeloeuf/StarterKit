# Starter Kit
THE goto app for startups that need assistance.
This app works as a list of F.A.Q to help Startups navigate the world of obstacles and help them launch with ease.
This repo contains all the static F.A.Q contents for the app/server to read from. Will start off using github pages to serve these data, but will move on to a server / CDN afterwards.

## How To Use
Install the StarterKit App on your phone or desktop and Voil√†!
