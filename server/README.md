I want this to become smth like a wikipedia + stackoverflow for startups.

There should be a dedicated section for faqs and startup guides, and also a place like stackoverflow for you to ask questions.

The website will have dynamic content but not interactive dynamic contents
Perhaps the static sites can be generated using Hugo

The stack will consist of:
- NGINX
- SQLDB
- NodeJS
-
